# NELLY Datasets

Datasets UNI1 and UNI2 were generated from [real packet traces captured in university data centers](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~tbenson/IMC10_Data.html). Both datasets are used in the evaluation of the paper "NELLY: Flow Detection Using Incremental Learning at the Server-Side of SDN-based Data Centers".
